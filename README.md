# get_next_line (GNL)

## Description

The goal of the project is to get the next line until a EOF is found, as the getline's function. The specificity of this project is that you're alow to use only one .c and one .h.
You can't read one by one.

## Usage

`gcc get_next_line.c get_next_line.h && ./a.out` (if you have a main inside)
